            <p>In order to record your calorie intake you need to do a bit of
                ground work.</p>
            <p>


            </p>
            <p>Suppose that you have just eaten a cheese sandwich. How do you
                record that? Well, you cant, at least not until you have done a
                little work first…</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <ol>
                <li/>
                <p>Go to “Add to Calorie List”.</p>
                <li/>
                <p>In “item name” name the kind of bread that you use.</p>
                <li/>
                <p>In “calories per 100g/100ml” enter the number of
                    calories.</p>
                <li/>
                <p>Press “Log it”.</p>
            </ol>
            <p>


            </p>
            <p>Go through the same process for the cheese, butter, and whatever
                else you put on your sandwich.</p>
            <p>


            </p>
            <p>Now that those basic foodstuffs are in your database, you can use
                them to make a cheese sandwich, (or anything else for that matter).</p>
            <p>


            </p>
            <p>You need to combine these basic food stuffs into something that
                you eat.</p>
            <p>


            </p>
            <ol>
                <li/>
                <p>Go to “Create New Combo”.</p>
                <li/>
                <p>Enter a name for your combo, e.g. “Cheese Sandwich on
                    wholemeal”.</p>
                <li/>
                <p>Click “Sumbit”.</p>
                <li/>
                <p>Go to “Edit Combo”.</p>
                <li/>
                <p>Select the combo you wish to edit.</p>
                <li/>
                <p>Click on the blue “+”.</p>
                <li/>
                <p>Select the basic foodstuff that you want to add, eg the
                    bread.</p>
                <li/>
                <p>Input how many grammes of bread are in the sandwich.</p>
                <li/>
                <p>Click “Add to Combo”.</p>
            </ol>
            <p>


            </p>
            <p>Repeat for all your other sandwich ingredients.</p>
            <p>If you want to remove anything, then click on the “X” sign
                beside that item.</p>
            <p>


            </p>
            <p>Your database now knows what is in your cheese sandwich, how much
                of it there is, and can calculate how many calories it contains.</p>
            <p>


            </p>
            <p>To see what a combo item contains, go to “Display Combo”.</p>
            <p>To see the calories in a combo item, go to “Display Combo
                Calories”.</p>
            <p>


            </p>
            <p>Now you are ready to record that you have eaten a cheese sandwich.</p>
            <p>


            </p>
            <ol>
                <li/>
                <p>Go to “Log Your Intake”.</p>
                <li/>
                <p>Select your combo.</p>
                <li/>
                <p>Change the date and time if the default does not suit</p>
                <li/>
                <p>press “Log it!”.</p>
            </ol>
            <p>


            </p>
            <p>To view your intake, go to “Display Intake”.</p>
            <p>This shows a list of your total calories per day.</p>
            <p>Click on a day, to see a break down of your intake for that day.
                Click on it again to collapse it.</p>
